# BLUEPRINT
Blueprints and Samples mainly for JAVA

Whenever I start a new project, start to learn something new, Google, Stackoverflow, the internet in general is a ggod starting point. Unfortunately most of the projects I found were outdated or not working with more or less current versions of linraries and build environments. The basic idea of this repositiory is to share samples of different technolgies ready to use with up-to-date software.

Even I know Eureka and Zuul may be no longer state of the art I find it easy to work with and these tools in conjunction with spring boot do exactly what's expected there fore you can find the following projects:

1. Infrastructure
   1. Eureka + SpringBoot + Rest Interface
   2. Zuul + SpringBoot (making use of Eureka)
   3. SpringBoot Sample Application (just connecting to Eureka)
2. NoSQL
   1. Hazelcast + SpringBoot + Rest Interface + Integration of Eureka and Zuul
   2. TODO: ElasticSearch + SpringBoot + Rest Interface + Integration of Eureka and Zuul
3. Tapestry 5.5
   1. SpringBoot + Tapestry 5.5 App + SpringBoot, which does ... well ... "nothing, but starting"
   2. SpringBoot + Tapestry 5.5 App + SpringBoot + Bootstrap 4 (bundle version) + some BS4 demo components 
   3. TODO: SpringBoot + Tapestry 5.5 App + SpringBoot + Bootstrap 4 + Jquery 3.x via RequireJS
   
 more to come.
