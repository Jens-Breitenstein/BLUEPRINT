# BLUEPRINT
Blueprints and Samples mainly for JAVA

Whenever I start a new project, start to learn something new, Google, Stackoverflow is a main starting point. Unfortunately most of the projects I found were a little outdated or do not work seamlessly with current versions of libraries / frameworks or build environments. The basic idea behind this repositiory is to share samples of different technolgies ready to use with up-to-date software.


1. Infrastructure
   1. Eureka + SpringBoot + Rest Interface
   2. Zuul + SpringBoot (making use of Eureka)
   3. SpringBoot Sample Application (just connecting to Eureka)
2. NoSQL
   1. Hazelcast + SpringBoot + Rest Interface + Integration of Eureka and Zuul
   2. TODO: ElasticSearch + SpringBoot + Rest Interface + Integration of Eureka and Zuul
3. Tapestry 5.5
   1. SpringBoot + Tapestry 5.5 App + SpringBoot, which does ... well ... "nothing, but starting"
   2. SpringBoot + Tapestry 5.5 App + SpringBoot + Bootstrap 4 (bundle version) + some BS4 demo components 
   3. TODO: SpringBoot + Tapestry 5.5 App + SpringBoot + Bootstrap 4 + Jquery 3.x via RequireJS
   
   
more to come (like AWS support, CAMEL, maven, gradle, Docker a.s.o). 

We are a team of passionate software developers and love what we do. And we are old, really old, but just let's say "experienced" instead.
